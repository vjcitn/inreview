# Introduction

This package surveys issues in the Bioconductor contributions repositories
with the aim of producing a structured summary of package objectives
and capabilities.

# Enumerating packages in review

```{r geto, messages=FALSE}
library(BiocRevSumm)
iss = get_repos_from_open_issues("bioconductor", "contributions")
head(iss)
```

# Acquiring a summary for a contribution

Here's an example package contributed from the bioconductor
GitHub organization.

```{r lk1, results="asis"}
summ = summarize_submission("https://github.com/bioconductor/AnVILVRS")
cat(strwrap(summ, 75), sep="\n")
```

# Creating a topical classification of packages in review

To produce the list below, we used gpt-4o


```
prompt = "Here is a list of github repository URLs for R packages and associated textual 
descriptions of package capabilities. Please group the packages into 
10-12 conceptual topics focusing on the molecular biology methods addressed by the package.  
Produce a markdown document with the grouping.  For each package in the grouping provide the URL as given."

urls = get_repos_from_open_issues("bioconductor", "contributions")


desc = lapply(seq_len(length(urls)), function(i) {
   Sys.sleep(15); 
   cat(urls[i], "\n"); try(summarize_submission(urls[i]))
   }) # costs
save(desc, file="desc.rda")

library(ellmer)
library(btw)
ch = chat_openai(model="gpt-4o")
dr = which(sapply(desc, function(x) is.na(x$summary)))
if (length(dr)>0) desc = desc[-dr]
ch$chat(btw(desc), prompt)
```
