Repository: https://github.com/guldenolgun/CATS

The CATS (Cancer Specific Transcriptomic Signature) GitHub repository by Gulden Olgun is a tool designed to identify a set of genes, or gene signature, that characterizes the activity of a specific biological process or cell state within a specific cancer context.

This is done based on three premises: preferential connectivity to the reference gene set in the PPI, preferential co-expression with the reference gene set in the specific context, and differential upregulation of the gene in the particular context. The tool can be used in a modular fashion, allowing users to create their own pipeline.
